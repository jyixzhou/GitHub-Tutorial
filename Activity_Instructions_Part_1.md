Slides and other resources can be found in the Google drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AzbOqtJWD5G6TCD9i60y0HzlQxl_ttwY?usp=sharing).

### Preparations 
- Open a GitHub account using your UCLA email address and apply for [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/benefits?type=student)

### Activities

1. Create a new repository under your own account
    - Look for a green buttom for `New` repository
    - Give a name (e.g. EPIDEM207-2025-winter) and a brief description of the repository
    - Set to *private* and check the box to add a README file

2. Add Dr Mayeda as a collaborator of your repo
    - Go to your new repo - `Settings` - `Manage access`
    - `Add people` - search for [@ermayeda](https://github.com/ermayeda)

*For the following activities, refer to the detailed instructions on the slides.*

3. Update the README.md file using the [template](https://github.com/jyixzhou/GitHub-Tutorial/blob/main/README.md)

4. Create a new folder called Project 1 within the repository
    - Note: GitHub does not allow an empty folder, so make sure to add a placeholder file (e.g. a one-line README.md) in the new folder.

5. Upload a file
    - You can use the toy scripts in this GitHub-Tutorial repo or download from the Google drive folder.
